INCUBARIUM

Exercises in artificial intelligence hacking.  These are my own toy
implementations of AI smash hits from the 70s, 80s and 90s, which I am
developing for educational purposes.

* ais.el -- artificial immune systems (modelling immune systems) 
* ann.el -- artificial neural networks (modelling neurons)
* ga.el -- genetic algorithms (evolving strings of numbers)
* ge.el -- grammatical evolution (evolving strings that make program trees)
* gp.el -- genetic programming (evolving program trees)
